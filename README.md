# 🌟 SvelteKit PWA Template

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the SvelteKit PWA Template! This project is a simple and efficient template for building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. It features SvelteKit, a fast and modern framework for building web applications, Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, and Workbox for service worker and caching, making the app installable, offline-capable, and fast.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Install dependencies using `npm install`, then start the development server with `npm run dev` and open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📦 Production Build
